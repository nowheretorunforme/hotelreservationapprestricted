It's just a simple to use hotel reservation app. It's simple, effective and very easy. This version is the "restricted" one, meaning it's only blocked to 101-106,201-206,301-306 ranges (18 rooms exactly) and it's hardcoded to fit that. The unrestricted version is truly boundless of the room restriction. It's beautiful for Windows and GNU/Linux systems but it should be compatible everywhere.
